# üîê Secure Chat App ‚Äì Setup & Usage Guide

## 2. üñ•Ô∏è Backend Setup (Python)

It's recommended to use a **virtual environment**.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Create & Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Navigate to the Backend Directory

> *(Assuming **`app.py`** is in a **`backend`** folder. If it's in root, skip this step.)*

```bash
cd backend  # Adjust this path if needed
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### ‚úÖ `requirements.txt` contents:

```
flask
flask-socketio
cryptography
gunicorn
eventlet
```

---

## 3. üåê Frontend Setup

No separate build step is needed.

The frontend `index.html` includes:

- React
- ReactDOM
- Babel
- Tailwind CSS\
  **All via CDNs**, simplifying local development (no `npm install` or `build` needed).

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### 1. Start the Backend Server

Make sure your virtual environment is activated and you're in the same directory as `app.py`.

```bash
python app.py
```

> The server will typically run at:\
> üîó [http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000)\
> or the port set by your `PORT` environment variable.

---

### 2. Open the Frontend in Your Browser

Once the backend is running, navigate to:

```text
http://localhost:5000/
```

> (If deployed on a hosting platform like Render, use the public URL provided.)

---

## üí° Usage

### üîò Register

1. Click **"‚úö Register"**
2. Enter a unique username
3. Click **"‚úö Generate Keys & Register"**

‚úÖ An RSA key pair is generated on the server, and you're logged in for the session.

---

### üîê Login

1. Click **"üîí Login"**
2. Enter your previously registered username
3. Click **"üîí Login"**

‚úÖ You're re-associated with your existing keys (in the server session).

---

### ‚úâÔ∏è Send Message

1. After logging in, the **"Send Message"** button appears
2. Click it and:
   - Enter the **receiver‚Äôs username**
   - Enter your **message**
3. Your message is encrypted with the receiver's public key and sent

---

### üì• Receive Message

- When a message is sent to you, an **alert** pops up in your browser with the **encrypted message**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Decryption is currently handled on the **server side**. For full E2EE, decryption should occur **on the client** using the private key.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

| Limitation                 | Description                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üîê **Private Key Storage** | Private keys are stored in-memory on the server (`private_keys` dict). Not secure for production.        |
| üß† **No Persistent Data**  | All registrations & keys are in memory. Server restart = data loss. A real app needs a database.         |
| üîì **Basic Login Only**    | No passwords, sessions, JWTs or cookies. Just temporary server-side user association.                    |
| üîç **Server Decryption**   | Server holds private keys, meaning it can decrypt messages. Not true E2EE.                               |
| üîê **No AES Used Yet**     | Currently, only RSA is used. AES-256 with hybrid encryption (RSA for key, AES for message) is ideal.     |
| üì° **Socket Rooms**        | Messages are emitted using `room=receiver`. For better control, manage Socket.IO session IDs explicitly. |
